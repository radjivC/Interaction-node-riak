test
Disk-backed in-memory database,
Dataset size limited to computer RAM (but can span multiple machines' RAM with clustering)
Master-slave replication, automatic failover
Simple values or data structures by keys
but complex operations like ZREVRANGEBYSCORE.
INCR & co (good for rate limiting or statistics)
Bit operations (for example to implement bloom filters)
Has sets (also union/diff/inter)
Has lists (also a queue; blocking pop)
Has hashes (objects of multiple fields)
Sorted sets (high score table, good for range queries)
Lua scripting capabilities (!)
Has transactions (!)
Values can be set to expire (as in a cache)
Pub/Sub lets one implement messaging

Best used: For rapidly changing data with a foreseeable database size (should fit mostly in memory).

For example: To store real-time stock prices. Real-time analytics. Leaderboards. Real-time communication. And wherever you used memcached before.
